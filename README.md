# 25_Fast_Draw_Python
Fast Draw, program which tests your reaction speed. My educational project from Al Sweigart's "The Big Book of Small Python Projects"


This program tests your reaction speed: press ENTER as soon as you see the word DRAW. But if you press it before DRAW appears - you lose.

In Python, time.time() is a function from the time module that returns the current time in seconds since the "epoch"â€”which is typically January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC on most systems. It provides a floating-point number representing the time elapsed since then.
This is often useful for measuring elapsed time in a program.
